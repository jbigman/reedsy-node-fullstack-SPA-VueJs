One of my significant commercial projects was **GameWisher.com**, a web application designed to help gamers find games based on multiple criteria and write reviews. From a backend perspective, this project is built using **Nest.js** and **MongoDB** to create a robust and efficient API.

### Project Overview

**GameWisher.com** aims to provide users with a platform where they can search for games using various filters, such as genre, price range, and platform. Additionally, users can write and share reviews, enhancing the gaming community experience. The backend was crucial for managing user requests, processing game data, and facilitating review submissions.

### Technical Implementation

1. **Node.js and Express -> NestJS**:
- I initially chose **Node.js** for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is ideal for handling multiple requests simultaneously. **Express** was used to set up a RESTful API that allowed users to interact with the application seamlessly.
- To enhance the structure and maintainability of the code, I later migrated to **NestJS** for endpoint validation and overall organization. NestJS provided a more structured approach to building the API, leveraging TypeScript to improve type safety and developer productivity.

2. **Data Scraping**:
- A key feature of the backend was implementing a **web scraping** solution to gather game data from popular online stores. Instead of relying on libraries like Puppeteer or Cheerio directly, I utilized existing open-source projects that parse data from the Play Store and Apple Store.
- I actively contributed to these open source projects by enhancing the parsing logic and fixings bugs and unit tests, which helped improve the reliability of the data collection process.

3. **Automated Data Refresh**:
- To ensure users always had access to the latest game information, i set up an algorithm that update fetched games once a day.
   
- I also set up **cron jobs** that triggers the data scraping process once a day. This automated task retrieves new games and new promotions, ensuring that the database remains updated.

4. **Database Management**:
- I used **MongoDB** database to store user data, game information, reviews, and articles. This choice allows flexible data models and easy scalability as the project grew.

1. **Recommendation Algorithms**:
- I developed algorithms to suggest similar games based on a specified game 
- I also developed an algorithm to recommend games that a user might like based on their previously liked games. 
  
  > These algorithms analyze various attributes such as genre, user ratings, and gameplay mechanics to provide personalized recommendations, enhancing the user experience and encouraging exploration of new titles.

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
- To ensure code quality and reliability, I created a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline using **GitHub Actions**. This setup automatically runs tests with **Vitest**, achieving a coverage rate of **80%**, and deploys changes to production when updates are made.
- The automated testing process helped catch bugs early, allowing for a more stable application.

### Lessons Learned and Future Improvements

Throughout the development of GameWisher.com, I gained valuable insights into backend development

- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data accuracy in scraped information and user-generated content is paramount. I developed a better understanding of the need for comprehensive validation and error-handling mechanisms to maintain data integrity.

Looking ahead, I have several plans to enhance the platform:
- **Incorporating Machine Learning**: this would improve searching with only request input and remove the old school filters.
- **Implementing Real-Time Features**: Adding real-time notifications for price changes or new game releases would increase user engagement.

### Impact

The backend architecture I developed for GameWisher.com was crucial to its success, enabling users to efficiently search for games based on various criteria and submit reviews. The recommendation algorithms provided personalized suggestions, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

Overall, this project significantly enhanced my skills in backend development with Node.js and NestJS, data scraping techniques, and building scalable APIs, reinforcing my ability to deliver robust web applications.
